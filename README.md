# Code to help me parse, bin, and filter Amazon job ads

This git repo is home to code designed to grab current Amazon jobs of potential
interest, process them into easier to analyze forms, and bin or filter them
down so I can more easily find and focus on interesting jobs ads with less
manual effort (especially less manual de-duping).

It is <i>very much</i> a work in progress. Who knows what I will value or try.

### TODO ideas:
* Use something fancier than bash. Like topic modeling.
  * Note: I actually have tried some topic modeling (with a Jupyter notebook),
but didn't get anything useful yet. It may not be a good set of data for that
technique.
